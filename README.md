## Lesson Plan 
Objective: Students should demonstrate a strong understanding of full stack web application development. This means that a student should be able to: 
1. Understand how to exchange data between the client and server side (how to make http request/ understand routing)
1. Retrieve data from external API and "scrub" the data for ease of use (how to make http request/ understand routing)
1. Compose functions that encapsulate logic for specific features, are able to handle various inputs and have comples logic abstracted into helper functions. 

## Instructions 
You are tasked with building a Reddit Clone! The application should allow a user to puruse a series of images, up vote or down vote an image, see the top images (images with the largest net score),  view the net score that each image has accumulated, and load additional images to vote on at the click of a button. If you need an simple example visit (Pleasant Pets Online)["LINK COMMING SOON"]. You can also visit [Reddit.com]("https://www.reddit.com/").  

The signatures of suggested functions are listed through out this project. Comments are also listed to guide you on how you should be constructing your functions to get the app to work. You are not required to use every function that is listed here or any of them at all. 

## Grading Rubric 
1. You wrote incomplete code. Your solution does not work and you have not shown understanding of any of the aforementioned concepts.
2. You have some code to show. Complete functions that show an attempt at putting core concepts into practice. However, your solution does not work. You have not completed the project. 
3. You have a semi working project. The page loads and we are able to view images at the very least. One to two of the required features are buggy, but overall you have demonstarted that you grasp the topics we are covering and are able to implement them with some effort.
4. You demonstrate full understanding and you are able to implement core concepts. Your projec  code works and includes all of the features needed with minor bugs if there are any at all.
